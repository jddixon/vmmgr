    * FIX: after conversion to Python 3, get three warnings about open
        sockets (used to be AuthFailures) when running testSetup.py

    * region parameter is RegionInfo object.  To use string name, try
            v = boto.ec2.connect_to_region('eu-west-1')
        which returns an EC2Connection object or 
            regionInfo = boto.ec2.get_region(regionName)

    * FIX: although ec2din succeeds, ./testSetup.py fails citing        * FIXED
        an AuthFailure.  XXX This seems to have been the result of      * FIXED
        using a string where a RegionInfo object was called for.        * FIXED

    * FIX: ./vmInit fails, complaining that Namespace object            * FIXED
        has no attribute 'vmmgr'                                        * FIXED

    * specify vmInit [options] [region]*
        - where no region specified, defaults to us-east-1

    * vmKill [options] instance [instance]*
        - -I option kill all non-core instances 
        - otherwise kill those listed, excluding core instances, even
            if listed
            * -f option forces kill, but requires explicit confirmation

    * vmLaunch
        - use Canonical Ubuntu LTS 14.04 image appropriate to region
        - must NOT duplicate/replace any of the 4 core instances
        - apt-get update 
        - install basic packages
            * aptitude 
        -G option installs Go and prerequisites
            * prerequisites: bzr gcc git libc6-dev mercurial
            * must mkdir /usr/local/src
            * edit /etc/environment using sed

    * respec vmList: 
        - its current form was hacked from a quite different application.  
            Change to list all instances in EC2, distinguishing the core 
            4 instances, which are presumed to be permanent, from others, 
            presumed to be temporary
        - need an option to list attached volumes 
        - need an option to list volumes not attached to any instance
            * these get listed under a pseudo-host which has a name
                derived from that of the zone
        - need an option to list installed packages
        - --allPackages option lists all, including core
        - otherwise list those named

    * specify vmScrub

    * specify vmUpdate

    * specify vmVerify 
        - boto script to verify tables in vmmgr/__init__.py

    * git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jddixon/PROJECT          * DONE
    * git push --set-upstream origin PROJECT                            * DONE
