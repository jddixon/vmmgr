    * respec vmList: its current form was hacked from a quite 
        different application.  Change to list all instances in EC2,
        distinguishing the core 4 instances, which are presumed to be
        permanent, from others, presumed to be temporary
        - need an option to list attached volumes 
        - need an option to list volumes not attached to any instance
            * these get listed under a pseudo-host which has a name
                derived from that of the zone
        - need an option to list installed packages
        - --allPackages option lists all, including core
        - otherwise list those named

    * add vmLaunch
        - use appropriate Canonical Ubuntu LTS 14.04 image
        - must NOT duplicate/replace any of the 4 core instances
        - apt-get update 
        - install basic packages
            * aptitude 
        -G option installs Go and prerequisites
            * prerequisites: bzr gcc git libc6-dev mercurial
            * must mkdir /usr/local/src
            * edit /etc/environment using sed

    * add vmKill
        - -a kill all non-core instances 
        - otherwise kill those listed, excluding core instances, even
            if listed
            * -f option forces kill, but requires explicit conformation

    * vmVerify: boto script to verify tables in vmmgr/__init__.py
