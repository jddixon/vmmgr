    * respec vmList: it appears to have been hacked from a quite 
        different application.  Change to list all instances in EC2,
        distinguishing the core 4 instances, which are presumed to be
        permanent, from others, presumed to be temporary
        - need an option to list installed packages
        - -a option lists all, including core
        - otherwise list those named
    * add vmLaunch
        - use appropriate Canonical Ubuntu LTS 14.04 image
        - must NOT duplicate/replace any of the 4 core instances
        - apt-get update 
        - install basic packages
            * aptitude 
        -G option installs Go and prerequisites
            * prerequisites: bzr gcc git libc6-dev mercurial
            * must mkdir /usr/local/src
            * edit /etc/environment using sed
    * add vmKill
        - -a kill all non-core instances 
        - otherwise kill those listed, excluding core instances, even
            if listed
    * vmVerify: boto script to verify tables in vmmgr/__init__.py
